LAYER IDEAS:
- applications layer:  volume, playback controls, apps launchers
    - application controls:  ctrl+pageup (browser tabs), undo/redo, 
        - menu-up/down/pick, fullscreen
        - bold/italic/underline ???, selectword, reply, forward, saveas, 
- console strokes: "cd ", "ls^M", .. ?  
    - console controls: "readline" has its own way to "select-all" and similar things
    |> this layer should be a "shift" of the applications one, since will have the same actions
- numerical:  numpad, F's, printsrc, etc
- programmers:  vim shortcuts, "make" macros
- macros:  email signature, select-all, copy/paste, 
- movements:  home, end, next, prev, pageup/down, scroll, zoom, browsers-next/back
- reverse mirror: one-hand mode
- lang chars: ñ, é, ç, ¿?, ¡!, €, copyright, etc...
- special/specific application controls if needed (like in a big video-editor application, control hotkeys)
- specific/special states launcher, for example: "bring my chat window and focus in the entry box", to move to specific things or states for commonly used things
- desktop controls: maximize window, maximize horizontally, focus left window, go to desk number, etc..
